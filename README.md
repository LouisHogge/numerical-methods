# Introduction to Numerical Methods and Project

## Project Description
In this project, we will study a simplified model of the global carbon-climate cycle for a hypothetical planet without oceans (on Earth, oceans absorb around 30% of CO2 emissions). This model will enable us to study the impact of greenhouse gases on different climate variables, and to test different scenarios for reducing CO2 emissions, as envisaged, for example, by the Paris agreements.
These scenarios may depend not only on political decisions, but also on the technological solutions that engineers and scientists are devising to combat global warming. Some of these solutions are at an experimental stage with pilot sites (e.g.: capture and geological storage of CO2), while others (use of aerosols or solar panels to modify albedo or limit incident solar energy) are more difficult to implement and are therefore studied more theoretically by numerical methods.
Here, we study a zero-dimensional system, i.e. a model that considers a single mean value for all variables (temperature, carbon and water) for the entire surface of the planet. We take into account the main phenomena influencing different climate variables, including global temperature. The sun's energy input, the planet's natural energy output and the greenhouse effect due to carbon and water in the atmosphere are studied. To do this, the exchange of carbon and water between the atmosphere and the ground must be taken into account.
